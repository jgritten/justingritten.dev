# System overview

What the site is and how it’s structured.

## Purpose

- **Portfolio:** Personal site for Justin Gritten—showcase and job applications (repo is public).
- **Demos:** UI components demonstrate patterns like lazy loading and API integration for recruiters.

**Live site:** [justingritten.dev](https://justingritten.dev)

### Demos

- **ProductList** – Primary demo: API integration and CRUD patterns. Intended for the final product.
- **FileExplorer** – Present in codebase for now; may be removed or hidden until there’s a clear reason to showcase it to recruiters.

## Frontend (client/)

- **Entry:** `client/index.html` → `client/src/main.tsx` → `App.tsx` (React Router). **Portfolio** routes (`/`, `/build`) use **`GlobalLayout`** (tabs + content + footer). **SaaS** routes (`/saas/...`) use **`SaasAppShell`** (full menu bar, sidebar, content). Visitors land as **Guest** with no login required on the portfolio (Phase 0 foundation; see [roadmap](roadmap.md)).
- **Portfolio shell:** **`GlobalMenuBar`** tabs (Profile, SaaS, Build & Activity), main content, **Footer**. **SaaS shell:** Menu bar (including client area placeholder), **Sidebar** (Dashboard, Create New, Search, **Settings** with Account / Application / Client under `client/src/Components/SaaS/Settings/`), modals, theme via user dropdown; persisted in localStorage. **Mobile:** Hamburger + slide-out behaviour on SaaS shell as implemented.
- **Structure:**
  - `src/api/` – API client and product endpoints
  - `src/components/` – React components (`AppShell` legacy barrel export, `GlobalLayout`, `SaasAppShell`, MenuBar, Sidebar, Dashboard, SaaS including `SaaS/Settings`, Footer, FrontPage, ProductList, FileExplorer, etc.)
  - `src/contexts/` – Theme context (theme state + persistence)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom hooks (e.g. `useFileNodes`, `useProducts`)
  - `src/types/` – TypeScript types
  - `src/styles/` – Global and component CSS
  - `src/utils/` – Shared utilities
- **Imports:** Use `@/` for `src/` (e.g. `import '@/styles/App.css'`).

## Backend (server/)

- **Entry:** `server/Program.cs` – configures EF Core (SQLite), CORS, controllers.
- **Structure:**
  - `Controllers/` – Web API (e.g. `MetricsController`); HTTP routing, validation, and response mapping only
  - `Services/` – Application services (e.g. `MetricsService`): orchestration and use-case logic between controllers and repositories; infrastructure adapters (e.g. email senders implementing `IContactEmailSender`)
  - `Data/` – `AppDbContext`
  - `DTOs/` – Request/response DTOs
  - `Interfaces/` – Repository contracts (e.g. `IProductRepository`), service contracts (e.g. `IMetricsService`), and other ports (e.g. `IContactEmailSender`)
  - `Models/` – Domain entities (e.g. `Product`)
  - `Repositories/` – Persistence only (e.g. `ProductRepository`, `MetricRepository`)
- **Layering:** Prefer **controller → service → repository**. Controllers should delegate orchestration to services; repositories should not be called from controllers for multi-step or multi-dependency flows (metrics follow this pattern). **EF Core and transaction/retry behavior** stay in repositories. API endpoints accept/return **DTOs** (not EF models). See [ADR 0007](decisions/0007-thin-controllers-repository-and-dto-boundary.md).
- **API base:** `/api/Products` (and related routes). OpenAPI available in Development.
- **SaaS tenancy (authenticated):** `GET/PUT /api/v1/Tenancy/workspace|preferences`, `POST /api/v1/Tenancy/clients`, invitation accept/decline — Clerk JWT; see [ADR 0011](decisions/0011-multi-tenant-clients-and-workspace-hub.md). The SPA hub is `/saas/post-sign-in`. **`GET workspace`** ensures a pending invite to the seeded **Northwinds Demo** client when the JWT includes a normalized email and the user is not already a member and has no prior invite row for that tenant+email ([ADR 0012](decisions/0012-northwinds-demo-tenant-and-auto-invite.md)).
- **Metrics endpoints:** Route tracking writes with `POST /api/metrics/visit`. Use `GET /api/metrics/summary?route=...` for single-route totals and `GET /api/metrics/overview?period=hour|day|week|month` for one-call period-scoped dashboard hydration (routes, outbound CTA totals, and daily totals).
- **Provider port pattern:** Contact notification delivery uses an interface-first provider pattern. `Program.cs` selects `Resend`, `Ses` (scaffold), or `NoOp` via `EMAIL_PROVIDER`, so provider changes do not require controller changes.
- **Multi-client frontend readiness:** The API should be designed so future clients (for example an iOS app) can reuse the same backend contracts with minimal backend changes. That means stable DTO contracts, predictable error handling, and backward-compatible endpoint evolution.

## Deployment

GitHub Actions deploys **both** the client (S3/CloudFront) and the **API** (Elastic Beanstalk). See [deployment.md](./deployment.md).

## Roadmap and planning

- **Feature roadmap:** See [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for planned features (auth, tenancy, WebSocket, notifications, layout), phased implementation order, and the reference principles used to stay on track.

## Where to extend

- **New UI/features:** Add components under `client/src/components/`, hooks under `client/src/hooks/`, and types under `client/src/types/`. Follow existing patterns (Radix UI, path alias).
- **New API surface:** Add controllers, DTOs, and repository interfaces in `server/` following the thin-controller pattern (see ADR 0007).
- **Design and decisions:** Update docs in `docs/` and add ADRs in `docs/decisions/`.
